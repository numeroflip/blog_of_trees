# Static blog site
## What is it?
It's just a simple static blog site ([Click here](https://numeroflip.github.io/blog_site/) to see it),
with a homepage layout, and a blog post layout which is visible if you click on the first post on the homepage (the one with the red "new" label).

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* And... That's all, no SASS, JS, or any frameworks.
## But... Why?
Honestly, I started learning web development a while ago, followed a bunch of tutorials, but never felt confident enough with my skills. Now I enrolled for the free month of Udacity's [Front End nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011), to check it out. They gave me a LOT of requirements in very general and  broad terms, and I had to implement a site myself from scratch. And so I did with plain HTML and CSS.  

Why about trees? I just have a strange admiration for trees, thet is all I guess :)

## Conclusion
Heck, I learned a lot. I gained a lot of confidence in using flexbox and the grid (in general, and for responsive reasons too).  I structured my code, and even implemented some utility classes for styling reasons, which was quite helpful. It was fun, but it was a bit time consuming too. I definetly start to see how helpful some css frameworks will be for me :)
